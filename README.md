# Cybrary-Intermediate-Python
Here's is a collection of scripts that go along with Cybrary's - Intermediate Python Course

There is a mismatch between the Module folders in this repo. The videos have the Module numbered 1-4, and the course itself calls the Modules 1-3. Module 1 is an introductory video module.

The course can be found at this URL:
